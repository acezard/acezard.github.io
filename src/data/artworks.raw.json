Galaxies spiral in, twisting and elongating into grotesque shapes as they are stretched beyond recognition. The void emits no light, only an all-consuming silence that drowns out the screams of collapsing worlds. Ancient, godlike figures hover at the edges of the destruction, watching as the last remnants of creation are swallowed. Time and space fold into themselves, leaving nothing but a black, infinite expanse where the universe once existed.<lora:atomeaser_v1:1> <lora:fantastic_planet_v1:0.2>",
